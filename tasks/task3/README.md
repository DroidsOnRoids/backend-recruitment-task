# Store
Let's imagine that we are building the store app.
It should be the simple store where we can just manage order and products (as admins) and be able to place the order as shopper.

Run the tests like before:
```bash
npm tests
```
Make them green.

1) Add more tests and code to make the store functional.
2) Create products repository.
3) Add shopper and admin user. Only admin can add products.
